# PokeGANs

- In this project, i have trained the Genarative Adversiral Network to generate new Pokemons.
- Data consist of 819 images with 256 x 256 pixels which I converted to 64 x 64 pixels for better computation.
- The images are in batch size of 16.
- I trained the model for 1000 epochs ans generated some fair images of new Pokemons.
- I've uploaded the generated images after every 50 epochs.
